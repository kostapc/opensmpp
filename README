OpenSMPP is based on the original Logica SMPP libraries. It contains
several bug fixes, and has been generally refactored.

This code is not widely production-tested, and no production
release has yet been issued. You should be using the latest
release of the 1.3 branch of the logica-smpp libraries
instead, for a production environment.
